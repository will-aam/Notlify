Create a complete Next.js 14+ project (using the App Router) in Portuguese (pt-BR) for a module called **Notlify** — part of a larger system called **Stock**. The module focuses on managing and notifying item cost variations and markup insights. Users can manually input data or upload PDF documents (NF-e or "espelho de lançamento") to auto-fill item details like name, quantity, unit cost, total value, supplier, and date.

### Project Requirements:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Language**: All UI text, labels, placeholders, buttons, and comments in **Portuguese (Brazil - pt-BR)**.
- **Theme**: Dark mode by default. Include a **theme toggle** (sun/moon icon) in the header that switches between dark and light modes. Use `next-themes` for theme management. Store preference in localStorage.
- **Pages/Routes** (create all as `.tsx` files in `app/`):
  1. `/` (Home/Dashboard): Overview dashboard with:
     - Summary cards: total items, items with cost increase >10%, items with negative markup.
     - Table of recent items (mock data): columns: Item, Current Cost, Previous Cost, % Variation, Markup %, Status (alert icon if negative).
     - Chart (use Recharts): line chart showing cost trend of top 5 items.
     - Button to go to upload or manual entry.
  2. `/upload`: Upload page:
     - Drag-and-drop or file input for PDF.
     - Preview area (show PDF thumbnail or first page).
     - "Processar PDF" button (mock processing with spinner, show extracted mock data in a table below).
     - Extracted fields: Item list with name, qty, unit cost, total, supplier, date.
     - Save button (mock success toast).
  3. `/manual`: Manual entry form:
     - Form to add one item: name, supplier, quantity, unit cost, sale price, markup desired (%).
     - Auto-calculate markup practiced.
     - Table below to add multiple items (add/remove rows).
     - Submit button (mock save).
  4. `/items`: Full items list:
     - Search bar, filter by supplier or markup status.
     - Paginated table with all items from history.
     - Export CSV button.
  5. `/suppliers`: Suppliers overview:
     - Cards or table: supplier name, total purchased, avg delivery time (mock), favorite toggle.
     - Click to view details (mock modal).
  6. `/settings`: Settings page:
     - Theme toggle.
     - Default markup % input.
     - Notification preferences (mock).
- **Layout**: Create a shared layout with:
  - Sidebar navigation (collapsible on mobile) with links to all pages.
  - Header with logo ("Notlify"), theme toggle, user avatar (mock).
  - Responsive: mobile-first, Tailwind breakpoints.
- **Components**: Create reusable components in `components/`:
  - `ThemeToggle.tsx`
  - `Sidebar.tsx`
  - `Header.tsx`
  - `DataTable.tsx` (with sorting)
  - `UploadZone.tsx` (drag-drop)
  - `ItemCard.tsx`
  - `ChartLine.tsx` (wrapper for Recharts)
  - `Toast.tsx` (for success/error)
- **Mock Data**: Use hardcoded mock data in a `lib/mockData.ts` for all tables/charts. Include at least 20 sample items with realistic variations.
- **PDF Handling Prep**: In `/upload`, prepare the form to send file to `/api/upload` (create the API route stub that returns mock extracted data). Do **not** implement actual PDF parsing yet — just mock the response.
- **Database Prep**: Add Prisma schema stub in `prisma/schema.prisma` with models for `Item`, `Supplier`, `Document`. Run `prisma generate` in instructions. Do **not** connect to real DB — use mock data only. Add env example.
- **Styling**: Tailwind with dark mode classes (`dark:`). Custom config with primary color #00d4ff.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation.
- **Output**: Provide the full project structure with all files and code. Include `package.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `next.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, and setup instructions (pnpm install, pnpm dev). Use pnpm as default package manager.

Generate the entire project ready to run with mock data, dark theme default, and fully in pt-BR.
